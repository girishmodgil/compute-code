* __greedy__ is an implementation of the greedy optimization algorithm

* __compute_intro__ is a notebook showing basic recursion and root finding

* The _Data wrangling_ folder contains Beer Data CSV from Stanford. I've shown some basic wrangling techniques that might be useful to business analysts.

* __estimate_pi__ is a Monte Carlo simulation example

* __graphs__ implements *depth_first search* algorithm<br />

* __Simple_Bayes_Marketing__ is a Python notebook showing how to estimate posteriors using observed data.

* __fast_fourier_transforms__ is my favorite subject from years past working in signal processing. Thought I would do a basic intro to show how to best use FFT.

* __infection_modeling__ is a folder containing an example of S-I-R infection modeling and data wrangling using publicly available data to draw some conclusions about cases and deaths from Covid 19.

* __eigenvalues_and_clustering__ is a work in progress notebook to go over some concepts for eigenvalues and k-means clustering

* __causal_impact__ is an example of bayesian structural time series modeling.
